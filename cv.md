### Welcome!

My name is Dmitriy. I'm a beginner frontend developer.

I learn in [RS School](https://rs.school/index.html) and at the moment I'm interested in mastering the following things:
* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown
* Git
* JavaScript
* basics of Node.js

Later I want to learn React and related technologies (Redux, GraphQL, etc.).
